We acknowledge: the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River peoples on whose sacred lands the University of Toronto operates; the  Alabama-Coushatta, Caddo, Carrizo/Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Comanche, Kickapoo, Lipan Apache, Tonkawa and Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo on whose sacred lands the University of Texas operates; the Woi Wurrung and Boon Wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands RMIT University operates. We acknowledge their Ancestors and Elders, past, present, and emerging, and we respectfully acknowledge their connection to Country."
