The International Workshop on NeuroPhysiological Approaches for Interactive Information Retrieval (NeuroPhysIIR'25) aims to bringing together researchers from information retrieval, information science, human-computer interaction, cognitive neuroscience, and related fields, to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress in neurophysiologically-informed IIR research. This includes research involving facial expression analysis, eye tracking, measurements of peripheral physiology – electrodermal activity (EDA), galvanic skin response (GSR), Photoplethysmography (PPG), etc –, brain-computer interfaces (BCI)  for measuring human reactions to information – electroencephalogram (EEG) or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based interfaces –, among others.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
 - Resources, methodologies, and/or best practices for neurophysiological IIR
 - Replicability and reproducibility of experiments using neurophysiological signals
 - Using neurophysiological measures for evaluation
 - Using neurophysiology as a feedback channel
 - Brain-Computer Interfaces for information retrieval and generation
 - Measuring user experience during human-information interaction using neurophysiological methods

 
## Before the NeuoPhysIIR'25 workshop (due ~~28 Feb~~8 March 2025)

1. Get a copy of the template: [bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_template](https://bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_template)
2. Write your statement using the template
3. Submit your statement by filling out the form: [bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_form](https://bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_form)

Statements and responses will be collected from potential participants that are willing to discuss challenges and opportunities to advance knowledge in neurophysiological approaches for interactive IR. 

A statement consists of about two paragraphs addressing each of the following **five points**:

### Problem

Who is it that has a problem, or an opportunity, with neurophysiological IIR? Please tell us something about a person, group of people, or a situation.

What are the problems or opportunities there? Please give as many examples and as much detail as possible – at least a paragraph. 

Why is the problem important and timely?

### Goal

What should the research community be doing to help? Please give as many examples and as much detail as possible.

### State of the art

A brief (!) overview of where we’re at now, and in which research field/domain.

What do we already know? What are the one or two key resources we already have?

### Next Steps

List any resources, collaborations, research goals, or anything else that may help along the way.

### Ethical Considerations

Please discuss any ethical considerations that may be relevant. For example, privacy and confidentiality of data.

### Summary 
Statements can be submitted by using [this template](https://bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_template) as reference and by filling out [this form](https://bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_form): [bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_form](bit.ly/NeuroPhysIIR_form).

## Between the submission deadline and the workshop (March 2025)

Statements will be made available to participants through a shared folder (T.B.A.) and in the workshop [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/qKm3PXQcv)

Responses to statements can be added as comments directly to the statements. You are encouraged but not required to include your name in the PDF file; if you don't, the statement or response will remain anonymous.

## During the NeuroPhysIIR workshop (27 or 28 March 2025)

We will have time to discuss statements and responses during the workshop. More details to follow.

## After the workshop (April-May 2025) 

Participants will collaboratively contribute to the writing of the workshop report, which will be submitted to SIGIR Forum.
