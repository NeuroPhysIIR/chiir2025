## Before the NeuoPhysIIR'25 workshop
Statements and responses will be collected from potential participants that are willing to discuss challenges and opportunities to advance knowledge in neurophysiological approaches for interactive IR. 

A statement consists of about two paragraphs addressing each of the following **five points**:

### Problem

Who is it that has a problem, or an opportunity, with neurophysiological IIR? Please tell us something about a person, group of people, or a situation.

What are the problems or opportunities there? Please give as many examples and as much detail as possible – at least a paragraph. 

Why is the problem important and timely?

### Goal

What should the research community be doing to help? Please give as many examples and as much detail as possible.

### State of the art

A brief (!) overview of where we’re at now, and in which research field/domain.

What do we already know? What are the one or two key resources we already have?

### Next Steps

List any resources, collaborations, research goals, or anything else that may help along the way.

### Positionality statement and ethical considerations

Briefly explain how author's identity relates to the work described in the statement, and how that identity may impact the research. Also briefly discuss any ethical considerations that may be relevant.

Statements can be submitted by filling out a form (link to be provided). Statements will then be made available to participants through a shared folder.


Responses to statements can be added as comments directly to the statements. You are encouraged but not required to include your name in the PDF file; if you don't, the statement or response will remain anonymous.

## During the NeuroPhysIIR workshop

We will time to discuss statements and responses during the workshop. Participants will collaboratively contribute to the writing of the workshop report, which will be submitted to SIGIR Forum.
