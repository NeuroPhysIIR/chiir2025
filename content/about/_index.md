The International Workshop on NeuroPhysiological Approaches for Interactive Information Retrieval (NeuroPhysIIR'25) aims to bringing together researchers from information retrieval, information science, human-computer interaction, cognitive neuroscience, and related fields, to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress in neurophysiologically-informed IIR research. This include research involving facial expression analysis, eye tracking, measurements of peripheral physiology – electrodermal activity (EDA), galvanic skin response (GSR), Photoplethysmography (PPG), etc –, brain-computer interfaces (BCI)  for measuring human reactions to information – electroencephalogram (EEG) or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based interfaces –, among others.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
 - Resources, methodologies, and/or best practices for neurophysiological IIR
 - Replicability and reproducibility of experiments using neurophysiological signals
 - Using neurophysiological measures for evaluation
 - Using neurophysiology as a feedback channel
 - Brain-Computer Interfaces for information retrieval and generation
 - Measuring user experience during human-information interaction using neurophysiological methods


As the third edition following successful workshops at SIGIR'15
and CHIIR'17, we anticipate that the interactive nature of this workshop will not only raise awareness but also lower the entry barriers for engaging with this exciting research area within the wider IIR community.
