The International Workshop on NeuroPhysiological Approaches for Interactive Information Retrieval (NeuroPhysIIR'25) aims to bringing together researchers from information science, human-computer interaction, cognitive neuroscience, and related fields, to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress in neurophysiologically-informed IIR research.

As the third edition following successful workshops at SIGIR'15
and CHIIR'17, we anticipate that the interactive nature of this workshop will not only raise awareness but also lower the entry barriers for engaging with this exciting research area within the wider IIR community.
