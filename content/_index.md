Note that registration costs are complimentary with a registration for the main conference.


The NeuroPhysIIR workshop at CHIIR 2025 aims to bring together experts and non-experts interested in advancing knowledge on how to effectively use neurophysiological signals captured with multiple wearable devices to characterize cognitive and affective processes that occur when we interact with information access systems, including search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. The workshop aims to lower the entry barrier to this research area, and researchers and practitioners without experience in any of the disciplines involved (cognitive science, information science, wearable computing, etc.) are particularly welcomed.
